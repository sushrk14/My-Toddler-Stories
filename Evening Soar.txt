SHOURYA'S EVENING SOAR!

Shourya Helicopter & his Amma - Airplane

One fine evening, Shourya, a 2.10-year-old toddler, accompanied by his mother, went to the terrace to soak up some Vitamin D. As they gazed at the sky, they spotted an airplane passing by. Taking cue from the sight, Shourya and his mother began to play, with her pretending to be an airplane and him a helicopter. After a few rounds of playful running, they finally settled down. It was then that Shourya, with a burst of imagination, declared himself to be an "automan." His mother, thinking he meant "pilot," explained the role, but Shourya insisted it was something else, "oh no no l forgot!" Before his entry into the sad mode, Amma guessed it right; he happily exclaimed he meant "astronaut" and began making rocket sounds as if he were soaring through space.

As Shourya immersed himself in his astronaut role, his mother took a moment to relax, kicking off her slippers and settling into a corner of the terrace. While she admired the view, something suddenly flew past her head. Startled, she realised it was her slipper, tossed down by the excited Shourya. Peering below, they couldn't spot where it landed. Balancing Shourya in one hand, she limped down with one slipper on her foot, while curious eyes observed them and their circus. Leaving Shourya at home, she descended to search for the missing slipper.

Downstairs, an uncle was sitting while enjoying the evening breeze, unaware of the flying slipper incident. Upon inquiry, he revealed that the slipper had narrowly missed hitting him and fallen nearby. Later, when the security guard arrived, he unwittingly tossed the slipper outside. With the help of the security guard, the toddler's mom retrieved the slipper from under an electric pole, bringing an end to the flying slipper adventure.

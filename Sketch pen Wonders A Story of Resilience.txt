Sketch pen Wonders: A Story of Resilience

One fine evening, a little boy was running around playing on the terrace like the wind, and he fell down multiple times. One time, he got hit on his chin and right knee.

After returning home and seeing the red mark on his knee, the toddler panicked and started crying. Amma reassured him, saying it would go away. "By tomorrow or the day after, it will turn red, then brown, then black, and it will heal completely. Let's apply oil, and 15 you-don-t-worry." The-baby-gained- some comfort.

The next day after his quiet playtime, he proudly showed off his right knee, now adorned with pink and black marks from his sketch pen. You know what? His wound is healed now! It's all black now! Who would wait for two days when he could solve the problem so easily!

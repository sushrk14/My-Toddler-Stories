There was a little boy whose tantrums started increasing when he turned 3! He and his mom wanted to go to the terrace. The little boy wanted to go by the lift, but Amma said the lift only goes to this floor, so they had to take the stairs. He still insisted on taking the lift.

Amma suggested they could take the lift to Maya aunty's home on the 1st floor, which he didn't want to do. Suddenly, the baby wanted to go to the terrace by the steps. While climbing the steps, he placed his napkin on one of the steps and stepped on it! Amma said it's dirty, and in response, he put the napkin inside his mouth!

Stunned, Amma silently went to the terrace and started picking dried clothes. The little boy followed after a minute. They started talking about sunlight and all, but the dirty napkin again went in his mouth. Amma asked if he liked doing everything she said not to, and if he was happy now. The baby replied, "No, I'm sad now. Sorry Amma, I will not do it again," with a puppy face.

Amma melted, ran, and hugged him, saying it's okay, not to repeat it, and how nice it was of him to realize it. Within a few seconds, the napkin was on the ground again. Amma decided to ignore his game, even if the little one called and threw his napkin everywhere.

While coming down, he started putting his napkin in the holes of the dusty gate, here and there. Amma ignored the mischief and came downstairs. After a few minutes, the baby came home giggling.

When asked about the napkin, it was found left behind on the terrace gate itself. Once again, both mother and son went up to collect it. The baby took his napkin and started throwing it on the ground again, putting it into his mouth. Amma couldn't control herself and shouted, "Cheee!" The baby started his mouth shower everywhere. After a few laughs and shouts of "chee," the sprinkler drama came to an end, and the napkin was placed in the bucket ready to be washed!

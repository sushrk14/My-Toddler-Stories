A 2.11-year-old toddler nowadays always asks for stories during lunch/sleep time, repeatedly saying 'One last story please, after that I will not ask!' Most of the time, he will only suggest the topics. Amma crafts the stories, incorporating lessons and realism. However, one day, tired of inventing tales, she handed the storytelling duties to Appa. Appa began a story that was entirely different from Amma's usual style!

<
There was a big town & there lived a minion who had 2 eyes, 1 nose, 1 mouth, 2 hands, 2 legs, 1 tail & 1 stomach. The toddler heard many stomachs. So Appa continued as many stomachs. Now, the reason for his peculiar name was his multiple stomachs! One fateful day, Minion crossed paths with a man named Timmappa Kulal. Minion hit him with his tail, so he got angry. Angered by the unexpected blow, Timmappa Kulal decided to teach Minion a lesson. He swiftly grabbed Minion's tail, tied it up, and applied oil and fire to it. As a result, Minion's tail underwent a dramatic transformation, leaving him tailless.

Throughout the story, the curious little listener had so many questions, much to the amusement of Amma, who struggled to suppress her laughter while Appa spun this unexpected tale.

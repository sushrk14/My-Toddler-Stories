Shourya's Ginger Crush Adventure


Today's kitchen adventure with a toddler involved extracting ginger juice for a recipe!

Shourya entered the kitchen, took a mortar and pestle, and began crushing leftover ginger. He asked his Amma to add a little water, which she did.

Sometimes, this pint-sized chef assistant takes on the role of a hilarious toddler instructor!

He instructed, "Ae jasti idikke hakubardu,
Swalpa swalpa neer haku, aayta!?" (Don't add too much, add water little by little, okay?).

He continuously murmured, "Oh no, how
much water did you put? What to do? How
much water!! Eshtu Eshtu," while taking his Amma's class.

Within a minute, he exclaimed, "Now I want water," and this time, he only added more water!

While crushing ginger, water splashed into his eyes, causing an irritating and burning sensation.

But nothing could deter our little chef and his dedication! Finally, he finished the job he insisted on doing himself and gave it to Amma, accidentally causing other vessels to fall down!
